[Instaraise](https://instaraise.io/) is building a DeFi Universe on Tezos. We support projects to raise fund, build communities and turn their ideas into products.Instaraise allows token-based projects in Tezos to raise funds by setting up a swap pool based on a fixed purchase rate for tokens. These so-called “Fixed Swap Pools” have many advantages for token sale investors over traditional fundraising models like ICOs, IEOs, and IDOs (Initial DEX Offerings). Fixed Swap Pools will maintain the token price throughout the sale until the initial supply is bought.

- usually we follow this file folder structure where in we place all our components in `src/components` and pages/containers in `src/container` with naming convention as `src/components/[name_of_component]/index.js` and `src/container/[name_of_page]/index.js` respectively.
- all our redux code is managed in `src/redux` and all actions , reducers are placed in respective folders for example `src/redux/actions` and `src/redux/reducers` with naming conventions as `[name_of_file].action.js` for actions and `[name_of_file].reducer.js`.
- we perform all the async operations in `src/redux/actions` with naming convention as `api.[name_of_file].js`.
